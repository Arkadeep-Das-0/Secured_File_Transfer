# Secured File Transfer System

## Project Description
This project is a basic implementation of a secured file transfer system using AES encryption for file confidentiality and SHA-256 hashing for file integrity verification. It demonstrates secure communication between a client and a server, ensuring that files are encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon receipt, with integrity checks to prevent tampering.

## Features
- **AES Encryption (CBC Mode):** Secure file encryption and decryption.
- **User Authentication:** Basic authentication to allow only authorized file transfers.
- **Integrity Verification:** SHA-256 hashing ensures that the file is not altered during transmission.
- **Socket Communication:** Client-server architecture for file transfers over a network.
